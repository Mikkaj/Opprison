##Should we send a message to all the online players with the permssion to freeze?
sendmsg-to-all-staff: true

##If the above statement is true the message below will be used.
msg-to-all-staff-freeze:
  - '&c%staff% &4has frozen &c%frozenplayer%'  #You can use the placeholders %staff% and %frozenplayer% here.
msg-to-all-staff-un-freeze:
  - '&3%staff% &bhas un-frozen &3%frozenplayer%'  #You can use the placeholders %staff% and %frozenplayer% here.

##I recommend keeping this true. It prevents players from jumping around and getting kicked for fly.
##Beware! Having this enabled will remove the potion-effects jump-boost and slowness on player join.
potion-effects: true  #This will give them slowness and jump-boost level 900. Which prevents moving.

##These are the messages sent to the player that is frozen and to the staff that froze them.
freeze-msg-staff: '&3%player% &bhas been frozen.'
freeze-msg-player: '&cYou have been frozen by &4%staff%'

##These are the messages sent to the player that got un-frozen and to the staff that un-froze them.
un-freeze-msg-staff: '&3%player% &bhas been un-frozen.'
un-freeze-msg-player: '&cYou have been un-frozen by &4%staff%'

##This is the message to send to players without the permssion 'pf.freeze'.
no-perm-msg: '&cYou lack the required permissions to use this command.'

##This is the message that shows when you do /listfrozen to list the frozen players. The placeholder %frozenplayers% can be used here to display a list of frozen players.
frozen-player-list-msg:
  - '&5&m=====&7 FROZEN PLAYERS &5&m====='
  - '&c%frozenplayers%'
  - '&5&m=====&7 FROZEN PLAYERS &5&m====='

##This option blocks all commands while frozen except the commands that you specify below.
block-cmds-while-frozen: true

##These are all of the commands that are allowed to be used while the above option is true and the player is frozen.
allowed-cmds-while-frozen:
  - 'f c p' ##You must use the command and the arguments!

##This is the large exclamation point//alert symbol.
alert-msg: true

##This is the message that will come after the alert-msg.
freeze-msg:
  - '&c&lYou Have Been Frozen! Logging off &b= &c&lBan!'
  - '&5&lPlease join TeamSpeak at &cts.ip.here&a!'

##This toggles the feature below.
logoff-command-toggle: true

##This feature will automatically run this command as console when a frozen player that doesn't have the permssion 'pf.freeze' logs off.
logoff-command: 'ban %player% Logging off while frozen.'  #Don't use a "/" infront of the command.
